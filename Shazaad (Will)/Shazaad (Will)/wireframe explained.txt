Paper wireframe - faster and easier to create, difficult to reference and share
digital wireframe - easier to share and reference, also easier to conver into a digital prototype.
Helpful Processes:
Sketch -> Wireframe -> Lo-fi Prototype -> Hi-fi Mockup -> Hi-fi Prototype -> Code
Sketch -> Wierframe -> Coded Lo-fi Prototype -> Coded Hi-fi Prototype -> Code Cleanup 
Wireframe - Shapes the final product, gives you a reliable idea of where eventually everything will go.
Mockup - Are strictly visual, experiment with variations and  solidify your visual decisions.
